# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis Challenge 7

## Overview of Project

The premise of this project was to future-proof the company by determining how many people will be retiring. In addition to those retiring, a subset of eligible individuals for a retirement package and mentorship program needed to be determined. This task was performed using SQL to import datasets, build tables, create queries for proper analysis, and export the desired information into new datasets.  Please see below for the analysis deliverables. 

- Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title

- Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program

- Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis 


## Analysis Results

- Viewing the total number of individuals retiring by department using the retiring_titles.csv, the company should be concerned as several thousand positions will be vacant once they leave. 
- Based also on the retiring_titles.csv, the company should heavily invest into recruiting engineers first followed by promoting individuals ready for senior staff positions and hiring new regular staff. 
- Another position that should be investigated for new hires or promotions is managers. Viewing the mentorship_eligibility.csv, no one is available to train new managers.
- Also, there is a severe lack of mentorship eligible employees to train a large set of new employees. Currently, there will be 72,458 employees retiring and only 1,549 employees with enough seniority to train new hires. The company will need to hire contractors to assist with the mentorship program or each eligible mentorship individual will be tasked to train a large set of new employees which would be unfavorable and unlikely to benefit the company in the long-term. 


## Summary 

- Currently, there will be 72,458 employees retiring with positions in senior engineering, senior staff, engineering, staff, technique leader, assistant engineer, and managers. The greatest impact of the silver tsunami will be felt by the engineering and staff sections. A strong priority should be made the company to fill these positions first. 
 

- There are only 1,549 employees with enough seniority to train new hires. The company will need to hire contractors to assist with the mentorship program or each eligible mentorship individual will be tasked to train a large set of new employees which would be unfavorable and unlikely to benefit the company in the long-term. Having mentorship eligible employees train large set of people will most likely result in inadequate training or a rushing learning environment. Which may lead to increased employee turnover or increased problems within the company due to lack of quality training.
